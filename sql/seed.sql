    ('Hello World!', 'I woke up on Monday morning nervous about being able to keep up and hold my own during class. Before DigitalCrafts, I had blown through a couple free trials of Codecademy, but other than some time spent on the pre-work, I had zero experience coding. I was battling imposter syndrome before even starting the class and was contemplating backing out of the program. Thankfully, I was able to push those thoughts aside for a bit and show up for the first Zoom meeting. There was a bit of information overload the first few days, but I loved that we started working with python and solving problems with code from the get-go. Needless to say, I’m here to stay! I can’t wait to learn everything I can about coding!', 1);

As someone who has actively avoided group projects since high school, I was a bit nervous. I wasn’t confident that I could support my group and help them create a product we were proud of. Luckily, I wasn’t alone and my team seemed to have similar woes. At first, we stumbled around together and lost many hours of our lives to figuring out git, but in the end, we created a functional and fun Pokemon game. It took us a day or two to hit our stride, but we eventually figured out the whole group coding thing. Read on to learn how to avoid our mistakes and come out the other end with a great game or project!', 1);

    ('Perspective Changes Towards the Internet', 'Prior to being a student at DigitalCrafts, I designed simple sites using platforms like Wix and Shopify. After a couple weeks of working at that job, I noticed that I started to consume content on the internet differently. I paid closer attention to layout, color schemes, typography, and even logos. The only time I went into the dev tools was to mine the client''s old site for favicons and logos that weren''t readily available to download. Now that we''re diving into CSS and HTML in class, the way I consume content on the internet has changed again. The dev tools are no longer scary (although still a bit overwhelming) and my thoughts have shifted away from "I like that design" to "I wonder how they did that".

    My favorite part about my last job was designing fun and visually pleasing sites. Ideally, I''d like to graduate bootcamp and be able create web designs that I could never achieve in Wix or a similar platform. Now, each time I visit a site, I find myself opening dev tools to gain a glimpse of all the working parts behind the site. I''m also constantly looking for new developers to follow and learn from on Instagram, Dribble, Medium, and other platforms. Once we get into JavaScript, I''m sure my experience using the internet will change yet again. Right now, the backend of the internet is kinda like a black hole to me; I''m not sure how it works, but I''m really interested in finding out (hopefully through reading articles and not by flying into a black hole)!
